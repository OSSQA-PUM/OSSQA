From the 9 dependencys in the example SBOM the token cost of analysing them were:
[38, 45, 88, 36, 26, 13, 12, 37, 98]

The Mean cost for a dependency was ca x = 43.7
With a Standard Deviation of ca σ = 28.5
Standard Deviation of ca s = 30.2
The highest cost a dependency had was a cost of 98
The lowest cost a dependency had was a cost of 12

95% Confidence Interval: 43.7 ± 18.6    (25.1 to 62.3)

The toal cost of analysing this sbom was 382

If we asume every dependency costs 62.3 (the highest value in our 95% Confidence Interval)
With a budget of 50 000 tokens we can afford to run this calculation for just above 800 dependencys per hour.
